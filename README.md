## Mission-Me Fork
We forked the player since we needed to add some custom code for our needs.
We favored a fork over a patch with `patch-package` since we feel that we have more control and transparency (with commits) over the code changes.

### The Motivation behind the code changes
- **Track-Ended Events**: To close the player when a unit finishes and to show an ask-to-review alert
- **Playback-Stalled Events**: To close the player when the loading is stalled. I couldn't find the motivation behind this.
- **Background Crash Bugfix**: There background crash rate of the player was very high and according to this post, there is a [fork](https://github.com/react-native-kit/react-native-track-player/issues/473#issuecomment-527936277) that fixes this problem. More details in this [ticket](https://github.com/gujgreenhouse/fasten_app/issues/590)
- (***Legacy***) **Authorization**: We used to send a special auth token when loading a track. We tested the app without this adoptions and locked content seems to load fine. Obviously with the new version this is not needed anymore or AWS changed something on their side. This is currently not entirely clear.

### The creation of this fork
- The Fork (`mission-me-2` branch) is based on the `dev` branch of the [origin repository](https://github.com/react-native-kit/react-native-track-player). 
- On this branch are 2 commits applied which add the `track-ended` and `playback-stalled` events. 
- Additionally there is 1 commit that is a squashed merge commit from the [bugfix branch](https://github.com/perushevandkhmelev-agency/react-native-track-player/commits/edge-2). We squashed the merge so that there is just 1 commit for transparency reasons.

## Why another music module?
After trying to team up modules like `react-native-sound`, `react-native-music-controls` and `react-native-google-cast`, I've noticed that their structure and the way should be tied together can cause a lot problems (mainly on Android). Those can heavily affect the app stability and user experience.

All audio modules (like `react-native-sound`) don't play in a separated service on Android, which should **only** be used for simple audio tracks in foreground (such as sound effects, voice messages, etc)

`react-native-music-controls` is meant for apps using those audio modules, although it has a few problems due to how the audio is not directly tied to the controls, it can be pretty useful for casting (such as Chromecast)

`react-native-google-cast` works pretty well and also supports custom receivers, but it has fewer player controls, it's harder to integrate and still uses the Cast SDK v2

## First Steps

If you want to get started with this module, check the [Getting Started](https://react-native-track-player.js.org/getting-started/) page.
If you want detailed information about the API, check the [Documentation](https://react-native-track-player.js.org/documentation/). You can also look at our example project [here](https://github.com/react-native-kit/react-native-track-player/tree/dev/example).

## Example

A basic example of how to play a track:

```javascript
import TrackPlayer from 'react-native-track-player';

const start = async () => {
    // Set up the player
    await TrackPlayer.setupPlayer();

    // Add a track to the queue
    await TrackPlayer.add({
        id: 'trackId',
        url: require('track.mp3'),
        title: 'Track Title',
        artist: 'Track Artist',
        artwork: require('track.png')
    });

    // Start playing it
    await TrackPlayer.play();
};
start();
```
